                                                form of
                                                brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with median survival being less than a year. The
                                                presence
                                                of a specific genetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter methylation has been shown to be a favorable
                                                prognostic factor and a strong predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy.

                                            plane divides the body into right and left sections. <br><br>

                                            The sagittal plane that is located directly in the center, making left and right sections of equal size, is
                                            appropriately referred to as the median, or midsagittal plane. A parasagittal plane is located to either the left or the right of the midline. <br><br>
                                            Axial planes are cross sectional planes that divides the body into upper and lower sections. <br><br>
                                            The term anterior and ventral refers to movement forward or towards the face. Posterior and dorsal are equivalent terms
                                            used to describe movement toward the back surface of the body. <br><br>
                                            Inferior refers to movement toward the feet or down and is synonymous with caudal or toward the tail or, in humans, the
                                            feet. Superior defines movement toward the head and is used interchangeably with the term cranial or cephalic. Lateral
                                            refers to movement toward the side of the body. Inversely, medial refers to movement toward the midline of the body.

                                            The term distal and proximal are most often used referring to extremities or limbs. Distal or away form, refers to
                                            movement toward the ends. The distal end of the forearm is the end to which the hand is attached. Proximal or close to,
                                            which is the opposite of distal, may be defines as situated near the point of attachment. For example, the proximal end
                                            of the arm is the end at which is attaches to the shoulder. <br><br>
                                            To help visualize the imaginary body planes, it is helpful to think of large sheets of glass cutting through the body in
                                            various ways. All sheets of glass that are parallel to the floor are called horizontal, or transverse planes. Those that
                                            stands perpendicular to the floor are called vertical, or longitudinal planes. <br><br>

                                            Oblique planes are planes that are slanted and lie at an angle to one of the 3 standard planes. <br>
